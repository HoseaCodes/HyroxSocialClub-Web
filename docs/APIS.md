## Computer Vision Solutions

### Azure Computer Vision Capabilities

#### Food Detection
- General food item identification
- Category classification (e.g., pizza, sandwich, salad)
- Limitations: No native calorie information
- Integration requirements: Separate nutrition database needed for caloric data

#### Person Detection
```python
# Core functionality example
from azure.cognitiveservices.vision.computervision import ComputerVisionClient
from msrest.authentication import CognitiveServicesCredentials

class PersonDetector:
    def __init__(self, key, endpoint):
        self.client = ComputerVisionClient(
            endpoint=endpoint,
            credentials=CognitiveServicesCredentials(key)
        )
    
    def analyze_image(self, image_path):
        with open(image_path, 'rb') as image:
            results = self.client.detect_objects_in_stream(image)
        return {
            'people_count': sum(1 for obj in results.objects 
                              if obj.object_property == "person"),
            'confidence_scores': [obj.confidence 
                                for obj in results.objects 
                                if obj.object_property == "person"]
