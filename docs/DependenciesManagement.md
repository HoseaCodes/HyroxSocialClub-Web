## **Dependencies Management Plan**

### 1. **Core Dependencies**
- **React Native and Expo**: For app development.  
- **AWS Amplify or AWS SDK**: For connecting to Lambda, Gateway, and CloudWatch.  
- **React Navigation**: For navigation between screens.  
- **State Management**: Redux, Zustand, or React Context.  
- **React Native Paper** or similar library for UI components.  
- **Axios** or **Fetch** for API calls.  
- **Day.js** or **Moment.js** for date manipulation.  

### 2. **Dev Dependencies**
- **ESLint** and **Prettier**: Code linting and formatting.  
- **Jest** and **React Native Testing Library**: For unit and integration testing.  
- **TypeScript**: For type safety (optional but recommended).  

### 3. **Dependency Versioning**
- Use fixed versions (`x.y.z`) in `package.json` to ensure consistent builds.  
- Regularly run `npm outdated` to check for updates.  

### 4. **Dependency Updates Workflow**
- **Weekly Review**: Check for updates to dependencies.
- **Testing**: Test all dependency updates in a staging environment.  
- **Lockfile**: Commit `package-lock.json` to maintain consistency.
